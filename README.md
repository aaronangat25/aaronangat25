I am a Full-Stack Developer who loves building end-to-end applications, from intuitive user interfaces to robust server-side logic. While I enjoy the entire stack, I am currently deep-diving into Backend Engineering to master database architecture and scalable systems.

🔭 Working on: A full-stack Movie Web App (PERN) & FinQuest (Godot Game Engine).

🌱 Learning: Advanced SQL Server management and Node.js internals.

💡 Interests: Stock market investing, cloud technologies, and database optimization.
